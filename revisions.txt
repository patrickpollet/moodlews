 1.5 released to Moodle forum
  1.5.1 :
    - make isteacherinanycourse Moodle 1.6 compatible
    - filtering events by type
    - function login :CAUTION : authenticate_user_login  WILL  create the user if
it does not exist AND the global authentication methods is not 'internal' (CAS, LDAP ...)

an existing account with internal auth method ! (a limitation that should be treated
but how to authenticate by CAS in this service ????)
